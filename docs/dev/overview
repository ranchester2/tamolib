TAMO Overview (I think).

After logging in, you just have a cookie or something similar, which
means you can fetch dienynas pages without getting redirected to the log
in screen.

Unfotunately, the vast majority are just places were you fetch the page,
and the server generates it with all your info. There doesn't really
seam to be an API.

However, very recently they introduced a new messages system, and this
does use an "api.tamo.lt" server. Which sounds like a very good thing.

However not all the pages are static like that, the schedule page is.
However the analytics page seams to use jquerry.

Also, because they put in a lot of syntax errors, the minification of
their main code file that gets sent to you failed! So I got it, and even
with comments (the comments are quite useless and awful though, code
also seams quite bad)
