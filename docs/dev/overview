TAMO Overview (I think).

After logging in, you just have a cookie or something similar, which
means you can fetch dienynas pages without getting redirected to the log
in screen.

Unfotunately, the vast majority are just places were you fetch the page,
and the server generates it with all your info. There doesn't really
seam to be an API.

However, very recently they introduced a new messages system, and this
does use an "api.tamo.lt" server. Which sounds like a very good thing.

However not all the pages are static like that, the schedule page is.
However the analytics page seams to use jquerry.

Also, because they put in a lot of syntax errors, the minification of
their main code file that gets sent to you failed! So I got it, and even
with comments (the comments are quite useless and awful though, code
also seams quite bad)


--Official Mobile App--

They also have an official mobile app, and this app has a lot of the
features of the website. And I __highly__ doubt that they are web
scraping their own website.

However, unfortunately I can't figure out how the hell to analyze that.

So, apparently you could use "tcpdump", so I installed tamo on my other
rooted phone, (on which for some reason TAMO almost immediatrly crashes
after signing in), and used tcpdump. And then I tried to open it with
wireshark.

HOWEVER THAT SEAMS ABSOLUTELY USELESS, I can see some IPs, but I can't
figure out how to find out what is in the data that for some reason
looks like completely random guarbage.

I also tried to decompile that, with a bunch of apk extractors, then an
apk to .jar converter, then a decompiler (and the search results about
decompiling for some reason are extremely full of crap), however that
didn't give me any useful results.
